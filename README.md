## ðŸŽ§ Overview
This repository contains a content-based music recommendation system developed using the "Top 10000 Songs on Spotify 1960-Now" dataset from Kaggle. The system recommends songs based on the similarity of features such as artist genres, danceability, energy, and more. By leveraging a TF-IDF vectorizer and cosine similarity, the system finds songs that closely match the user's input song, providing a personalized music experience.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
The project uses the "Top 10000 Songs on Spotify 1960-Now" dataset, which includes songs released between 1960 and the present. This dataset is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/top-10000-spotify-songs-1960-now/data).

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing:**
   - **Loading the Dataset:** Import the "Top 10000 Songs on Spotify 1960-Now" dataset.
   - **Feature Selection:** Analyze key features like artist genres, danceability, energy, and more.
   - **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing values, normalize data, and prepare it for modeling.

2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - **Textual Features:** Use TF-IDF vectorization for textual features like artist genres.
   - **Numerical Features:** Scale numerical features such as danceability and energy.
   - **Combining Features:** Merge all relevant features into a single feature matrix for similarity computation.

3. **Similarity Calculation:**
   - **Cosine Similarity:** Implement cosine similarity to measure the closeness between songs.
   - **Recommendation Function:** Build a function to recommend songs based on input criteria.

4. **Model Evaluation and Testing:**
   - **Testing Recommendations:** Test the recommendation system with various songs.
   - **Performance Evaluation:** Analyze the effectiveness of the recommendations.
